# One-Time-Password-Token-Project

Implementation of a Feedback One-Time Password Algorithm (FOTP)

For the Hash Feedback One-Time Password Algorithm described in the following chart. A secret key is used as the initialization vector. The first OTP is generated by  hashing this vector. The second OTP is generated by hashing the hash generated by the first the 1st OTP, and so on. The OTP is calculated by truncating the hash into a six-digit value.

Key part of the project:

A.	OTP token Generator

B.	Test OTP UI

C.	Synchronization of test OTP UI and token OTP UI

D.  Study of the collision resistance proterty, by generating 1,000,000 OTPs using the application and showing a graph describing how the collision properties evolve as the number of OTPs increases.

E.  Checkingthe number of similar two consecutive OTPs in N
